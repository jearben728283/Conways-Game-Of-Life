# Conways-Game-Of-Life

This app illustrates Conway's Game of Life in a simple way.

There's a grid in the game in which the player can design some patterns. by putting cells in different positions.

The rules in this simulation are that a living cell confining with other 2 or 3 cells, continues to live in the following generation.
If the confining cells are more then 3, the cell dies from overpopulation.
If there are less then 2 cells bounding, the cell dies from loneliness.

A cell is born in an empty position if there are 2 confining living cells.
